version 0.9.6
- updated citation information.
- bug fix: in former versions of Gapfill the error
  'Error in rq.fit.br(x, y, tau = tau, ...) : Singular design matrix'
  occurred if a subset used for the prediction contained very few
  observed values. This error does no longer stop the gap-filling.
  See the new argument 'qrErrorToNA' in ?Predict.

  See the description of the 'subset' argument in ?Gapfill.
